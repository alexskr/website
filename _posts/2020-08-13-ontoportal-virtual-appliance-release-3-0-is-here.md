We are _thrilled_ to announce the official release of our updated Virtual Appliance, OntoPortal Release 3.0 (3.0.2, to be precise). Most of the technical details are documented in our [OntoPortal Administration Manual](https://ontoportal.github.io/administration/) (also new!), but here’s the quick scoop on the most urgent things for you to know.

What’s In It?
-------------

Lots of good stuff. Here’s the quick take:

*   All the features, speed, and reliability in the latest BioPortal code
*   Improved annotations: AnnotatorPlus from LIRMM’s AgroPortal team
*   Easier installation as a Virtual Machine
*   Support for Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) deployments
*   Immediate gratification with a 30-day trial installation
*   Easy registration (free to non-profits and educational institutions)
*   Compatibility with Allegrograph v7.0 (we tested it!) via SPARQL 1.1
*   Easier upgrading and “upgrade available” notifications
*   Easier, more powerful administration features
*   Better documentation to get your Appliance up and running faster
*   So many bug fixes, API enhancements, and speed improvements

How do I get it and use it?
---------------------------

It’s simple!

*   Optional: Go to the [administration pages](https://ontoportal.github.io/administration/) and read what interests you
*   Mainly: Visit the [Getting Started](https://ontoportal.github.io/administration/steps/getting_started/) section to see how to download and install the Appliance
*   When you’re ready: Go to the [licensing server](https://license.ontoportal.org/) and register your appliance

We tried to make this easier for you to get started. So you get a 30-day trial period to play with it, then you’ll need to register to avoid the nag-ware (and to be compliant with the usage requirements).

About licensing
---------------
