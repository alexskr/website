The OntoPortal Alliance is an emerging consortium that will focus on establishing, advancing, and sustaining OntoPortal software and services for the research community.

> We saw the need for the OntoPortal Alliance as the number of BioPortal software deployments continued to grow, and as more funded and targeted repositories built around the NCBO BioPortal software identified an increasing array of common needs and goals. I’m delighted to help this public community become established to carry BioPortal’s tradition of research support forward.
