We are _excited_ to announce the kickoff of the OntoPortal Alliance from May 18 to 20! The meeting was originally planned in Montpellier, France but will finaly occur online! 

Many things about the Alliance are still taking shape—like this web site—and we are pursuing funding to help us accelerate our collaboration. We have big hopes for a lot of achievements in 2020, which we will chronicle here, on the GitHub organization site, and in other to-be-established social channels.
